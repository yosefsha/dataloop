# **data-managment-interview**
### Description
 - Public repository with the data management team's technichal interview assignment inside  
 ---
 ## Assignment specification:
Your assignment is to insert data about street names in israel to a database, using some kind of a queueing platform.\
The assignment is to be done in nodejs + Typescript (node version 16.X, npm version 8.X, typescript version 4.X).\
Inside of the repository you will find a StreetsService class which provides you the data from the api.\
The list of cities is provided inside of the cities.ts file.\
Feel free to make changes to the StreetsService class if you feel they are necessary.
 - If you want to take a look at the raw data - https://data.gov.il/dataset/israel-streets-synom/resource/1b14e41c-85b3-4c21-bdce-9fe48185ffca

To complete the assignment you will need to select a database, sql or no-sql (for example: mongo, singlestore) and a queueing service (for example - rabbitmq, kafka), either from the provided dependencies, or one of your choice (commit it to your solution if you chose a different one).\
You will need to create two services:
 - Publishing service - A service that will get the data from the StreetsService and publish it to the queuing platform
 - A service that will consume the data from the queuing service and persisit it to the database

 Publishing service specification:
  - Will be activated by CLI, accepting a city name from the list of cities
  - Will query the StreetsService for all streets of that city
  - Will publish to the queuing platform the streets it needs to insert

Consuming service specification:
  - Will consume from the messaging queue
  - Will persist the streets data to the selected database

The persisted streets need to contain all data from the api
---
## Provided dependencies:
 Provided is a docker-compose file which contains all of the dependencies that you will need to complete the assignment.\
 **You do not need to lift all of the services**, you can choose which you need as listed in the assignment specification.

  - mongoDB
  	- No-sql database, Version - 4.2
	- exposed on localhost port  27017
